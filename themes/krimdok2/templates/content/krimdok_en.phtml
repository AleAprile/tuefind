<h1>Database KrimDok</h1>

<p>
KrimDok is a bibliographical reference system for criminological literature. The Database consists of several different literature and book inventories, which were originally created according to various aspects. However, research in the database is possible by using just one search interface. In addition, various research strategies may be applied.<br/>
The stock of the Institute for Criminology (Institut für Kriminologie) in Tübingen is mainly focused on literature in the German language, the inventory of the Criminological Information Service (Fachinformationsdienst Kriminologie – FID) on the other hand, which is located within the library of the University of Tübingen, is specifically focused on literature in foreign languages (mainly monographs). None independent writings (for example essays) are being made available in KrimDok through a selection of important international journals and serials.<br/>
Aside from the specifically criminological literature, other literature with relevance for criminological research such as literature of fundamental sciences and reference disciplines, especially those which are of criminological relevance – even in the wider sense – are being included as much as possible. Some of those fields which are covered in the FID stock are: legal sciences (especially criminal justice, the penal system, criminal procedure code) criminalistics (to include law enforcement research), empirical law research, psychology (especially forensic psychology, legal psychology and social psychology), psychiatry (especially forensic psychiatry and court ordered treatment), sociology (especially legal sociology and criminal sociology) and pedagogy (including social pedagogy).<br/>
