    KrimDok is a bibliographical reference system for criminological literature. The database consists of various literature and book balances but also contains individual references of journals and collections, digital documents as well as grey literature. All references can be researched by utilizing the search interface.

                Since 1990, KrimDok is being established as a digital reference system for criminological literature, in the beginning as a CD-ROM, since 1999 online. It is the electronic successor of the “Heidelberg documentation of criminological literature in the German language”, which was a collection of flashcards established between 1963 and 1989. For decades the Institute for Criminology at the University of Tübingen (formerly under Prof. Dr. Hans-Jürgen Kerner, currently under his successor Prof. Dr. Jörg Kinzig) as well as the Institute for Criminology at the University of Heidelberg (Prof. Dr. Dieter Dölling) collaborated to index journals for KrimDok. Until 1998 the Police college in Villingen-Schwenningen (Prof. Dr. Thomas Feltes) was involved as well in registering literature for KrimDok.

                Up to the end of 2013, KrimDok mainly registered monographs from the collection of criminological literature in Tübingen. This includes the collection of the Institute for Criminology as well as its library, but also literature from the special collection criminology of the university library. References for which there was no physical copy available at the University of Tübingen (for example digital sources without access license) were only included very rarely. Since 2014 the German Research Foundation is sponsoring the Criminological Information Service and a new strategy was applied: Now all monographs relevant to criminology are being referenced in KrimDok, regardless of their availability in Tübingen, with the aim to make the collection as comprehensive as possible. The content of the reference system hence evolved from being a reference system for locally available hard copies to a bibliographical database covering multiple sources and collections. Due to the former special collection Criminology (Sondersammelgebiet Kriminologie, SSG Criminology) and the current Criminological Information Service (Fachinformationsdienst Kriminologie, FID Criminology), one of the largest collections of criminological research was created in Tübingen. In this light, for many of the references there are still hard copies available in Tübingen, which can be used locally or ordered via the interlibrary system.

                The inventory of the Institute for Criminology in Tübingen is mainly focused on criminological literature in the German language. Contrary to the Institute for Criminology, the Tübingen University library mainly acquires literature in foreign languages. Besides criminological literature, the University library also tries to acquire relevant literature of fundamental and reference sciences. More information is available in the <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'acquisition'])?>">acquisition profile</a>. An overview of recently acquired monographs can be found in the <a href="http://biber3.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/nelol/cgi-bin/neuerw.pl?loc=krim" target="_blank">list of new acquisitions</a> of the Criminological Information Service.

                Non-independent writings (such as journal articles) are made available to KrimDok by registration of important national and international journals as well as publication series. Currently, 130 journals are being fully or partially evaluated. For the FID funding period 2017-2019 it is planned to evaluate 40 additional journals. An overview of the evaluated journals can be found in the <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'journals']) ?>">list of journals</a>.

                The inventory of the Institute for Criminology, monographs as well as a selection of journals, can be found by searching for local (non-standardized) key words (since 1990, older literature only selectively). In addition, monographs are linked with key words according to RSWK-standards (rules for the key word catalogue) and searchable with the internal classification system. The inventory of the FID Criminology at the University library can also be researched by standardized key words according to RSWK rules.

                The Allegro-based database, established in the first decades, was migrated to a VuFind-System during the FID funding period of 2014-2016, in order to offer a modern and faceted search interface. The information provided to each reference is constantly being expanded, for example regarding the online accessibility of electronic media as well as the query of availability of hard copies in other locations (HBZ Gateway). Whenever possible, content information to references is being added in order to facilitate literature research (abstracts, tables of content, blurbs etc). In the section “similar entries” suggestions for further, potentially interesting bibliographic references in the context of the current search parameters in KrimDok, are being presented.
