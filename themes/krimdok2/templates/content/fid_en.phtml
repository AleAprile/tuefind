    <ul>
        <li>120,000 monographs</li>
        <li>240 active journal subscriptions</li>
        <li>230 digital documents in DigiKrimDok as well as</li>
        <li>800 digital documents are part of the repository.</li>
    </ul>
    Most important research tool for the literature inventory as well as for bibliographical references, is the database KrimDok. In this database, are currently about 240,000 references.

                Since 1969 the acquisition and collection of criminological special literature at the University of Tübingen was intensified. This has always been achieved with a cooperation between the Institute for Criminology, the university library and the University of Tübingen and sponsoring by the German research foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft – DFG).<br/>
                The first special inventory called “collection focus criminology” was evaluated by the German research foundation between 2011 and 2013 and afterwards transferred to a supra-regional funding program of the DFG and continued as the “special collection criminology” (Sondersammelgebiet (SSG) Kriminologie).<br/>
                Since 2014 the acquisition of new literature - following a new structure after changes in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dfg.de/foerderung/programme/infrastruktur/lis/lis_foerderangebote/fachinformationsdienste_wissenschaft/index.html">DFG guidelines</a> for supra-regional literature and information supply in sciences – is sponsored in the scope of the “Criminological Information Service” (Fachinformationsdienst Kriminologie – FID).

                The FID Criminology, like its predecessors, continues to focus on the task to supply the supra-regional scientific community with literature in the field of criminology. However, this task has been redefined: In the past, the main focus was to acquire foreign language (mainly English) literature as well as literature of other relevant fields as thoroughly as possible and to make it available to the scientific community. According to this new concept, the goal is to build an information structure following the principle of “interest of research”, which means, the focus is to acquire literature that research is specifically interested in and meets the scientific community’s wants and needs. The most important research tool to all formats of criminological literature (books, journal essays, documents etc.) is the KrimDok database provided by the Institute of Criminology in cooperation with the university library of the University of Tübingen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new focus of the supra-regional literature supply includes efforts to extend full text offers, and to provide more digital media. With the DFG sponsored project <a target="_blank" href="http://idb.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/digitue/krimdok/">“DigiKrimDoc”</a>, publications relevant to criminology are being digitalized and made available online to the scientific community. The criminological <a target="_blank" href="http://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/56358?locale-attribute=de">repository</a> of the university library contains digitally published research and subject relevant documents (for example reports of ministries and official statics etc).

                Aside from the constant expansion of the literature inventory in Tübingen and the registration of single contributions from a selection of field specific journals, publication series and compilations, in the first sponsoring period of the FID mainly technical projects were targeted to lay a foundation for future project components. As one example, the database was migrated from an Allegro based system to a VuFind-system and now offers more facetted search options. In addition, the environment for the repository as well as DigiKrimDok was established and supplied with the initial documents. The focus of attention, however, was supplying full texts and digitalizing literature which is now in the public domain or to acquire permission for secondary publication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the expansion of content from a reference system of hard copies to a general bibliographic reference system, <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'partners'])?>">cooperation</a> with other institutions was sought. To improve networking between institutions relevant to criminology as well as to create (potential) cooperation with the FID, a colloquium was held in March 2015 with about thirty representatives of various institutions in Tübingen.

                Within the current sponsoring period, further specialist literature will be acquired, processed and referenced. The data base will be supplemented with even more references due to cooperation with other relevant institutions. This approach will be gradually extended with the goal to create a comprehensive documentation of primarily German, but also foreign language criminological literature. Special attention will be paid to improve the accessibility of complete electronic text sources, for example by providing further documents in the repository, by listing sources to e-books relevant to criminology or to provide a list of interesting <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'journals']) ?>">open-access journals</a>.

                In addition, the <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'krimdok'])?>#development">technical development</a> of the data basis KrimDok will be advanced regarding full text indexing and the extension of faceting. The current home page of KrimDok will be changed into a platform for key information about the department as well as the FID. News from different institutions (such as conference or congress announcements or job openings, etc.) for example can now be announced in the <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'news'])?>">notifications and dates</a> section of the KrimDok portal page. If you have any suggestions that should be added, please do not hesitate to contact us: <a href="mailto:fidkrim@ifk.uni-tuebingen.de">fidkrim@ifk.uni-tuebingen.de</a>.
                Darüber hinaus wird die Datenbank <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'krimdok'])?>#development">KrimDok technisch</a> weiterentwickelt, etwa hinsichtlich der Volltextindizierung und der Erweiterung der Facettierung. Die bisherige Startseite von KrimDok wird zu einer Plattform für zentrale Informationen rund um den Fachbereich und den FID umgestaltet. So können nun beispielsweise aktuelle Nachrichten aus den einzelnen Institutionen (etwa Konferenz- und Tagungsankündigungen, Stellenausschreibungen etc.) über die Rubrik <a href="<?=$this->url('content-page', ['page' => 'news'])?>">Mitteilungen und Termine</a> auf der KrimDok-Portalseite bekannt gemacht werden.
