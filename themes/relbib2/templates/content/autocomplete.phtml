<h1 id="anchor">Autocomplete</h1>
<p>The search slot in RelBib is provided with an autocomplete function: Depending on the selection of the search aspect, the beginning of a word is completed to person names or subject headings in a meaningful way. Names of persons or subject headings that begin with the same letters appear in a list for selection. When searching via "All fields" or "Title", a list with titles is offered in which the searched word / part of the searched word appears. You can then select one of the suggested terms or titles and start the search by clicking on the red button.</p>
