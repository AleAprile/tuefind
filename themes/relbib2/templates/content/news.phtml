<h2><b>K10plus</b> – a gain also for RelBib</h2>
<p>At the end of March, a major library project was brought to a successful conclusion: the Göttingen Library Network (GBV) and the Southwest German Library Network (SWB) have been merged. The outcome is a large data pool called <a href="https://wiki.k10plus.de/display/K10PLUS/Allgemeines+zur+Kooperation+BSZ+und+GBV" target="_blank">K10plus</a> which comprises over 180 million data records from libraries in ten federal states.</p>
<p>The advantage for RelBib - many relevant records of libraries from the GBV area (including the SUB Göttingen, but also ULB Halle, TIB etc.), can now be easily tagged with the RelBib mark and thus made available in the bibliography.</p>

<p>Our DFG proposal for further funding of the FID Religionswissenschaft for the next three years was approved with very benevolent votes of the expert jury and we are looking forward to tackling our various tasks and goals with fresh energy in January.</p>
<p>The main tasks for the second funding period (2019-2021) are in brief:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>acquisition</b> of academic literature according to the defined subject profile for the coverage of the peak demand</li>
    <li>
        substantial content expansion of the Open Access bibliography <b>RelBib</b> by
        <ul>
            <li>indexing of articles in <b>collections</b> (conference proceedings, Festschrift etc.)</li>
            <li>inclusion of a larger number of <b>journals</b> in RelBib at the article level.</li>
            <li>retrospective cataloguing of <b>older volumes of journals</b> that are already indexed at the article level</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>After a long period of preparation we will finally start the FID <b>self-archiving service</b>. Those authors who responded to our survey last year will successively be contacted by us and asked for their literature lists.</li>
    <li>We are particularly proud and happy to have found <b>cooperation partners</b> with <b>REMID e.V.</b> and the <b>Marburg University Library</b>: The REMID archive collection has been managed by the REMID association so far and now will be permanently transferred to Marburg University Library, where it will be properly indexed in form and content during the next three years. The archive comprises approx. 580 journals, 80 of them current titles, and approx. 800 to 900 thematic folders with brochures and materials. The data will then be migrated to RelBib. Thus, for the first time it will be possible to search for archive material in the bibliography.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Zotero Group: How journal articles get indexed in RelBib</h2>
<p>In RelBib, journals relevant to the study of religion are listed not only as a whole, but also by their individual articles. But how do they get into RelBib? Our staff enter the article metadata (i.e. title, author(s), year of publishing, journal title etc.) into the cataogue of the Southwest German Library Network (SWB). This is very time-consuming and we have only limited personnel capacities. In many cases iti is possible to retrieve the article metadata semi-automatically with the help of the open source software Zotero. However, there are journals where this procedure does not work (so well). In order to be able to include the articles of these journals in RelBib, we have developed a simple procedure for cooperative indexing. Interested editors join our "Zotero Group" and enter the article data we need for RelBib. This is not a difficult task and we will support you in all questions. On our homepage you will find instructions for this procedure under <a href="/docs/ZoteroGroup_Instruction_de.pdf" target="_blank">"RelBib A-Z"</a>.</p>

<h2>Follow-up application submitted!</h2>
<p>The FID Study of Religion is currently in its last year of DFG funding. For a further funding period of three years (2019-2021), we submitted a follow-up proposal to the DFG on 1 May. Project objectives and work steps for the new funding period have been drafted in close consultation with the new FID advisory board, which represents the interests of the academic community.</p>

<h1 id="03_2018">RelBib News 03_2018</h1>
<h2>Academic Advisory Board of the FID Religionswissenschaft</h2>
<p>In January 2018, an advisory board for the FID Study of Religion was founded, consisting of five representatives of the subject. The advisory board met for the first time on 21st March 2018 in Tübingen.</p>
<p>The main task of the advisory board is to act as a link between the scholars of religion and the FID. There are regular meetings at which (new) steps in the work of the FID are to be discussed constructively. The advisory board will transfer the FID services already offered to the scientific community and give feedback to the FID from there, so that there is comprehensible clarity as to whether and how individual services should be expanded or restricted in future.</p>
<p>Current members of the FID advisory board are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prof. Dr. Grit Klinkhammer (University of Bremen / chairwoman of the DVRW)</li>
    <li>Prof. Dr. Monika Schrimpf (University of Tübingen)</li>
    <li>Prof. Dr. Horst Junginger (University of Leipzig)</li>
    <li>Dr. Martin Radermacher (CERES Bochum)</li>
    <li>Moritz Klenk (Universitäten Bern / Bonn).</li>
</ul>
