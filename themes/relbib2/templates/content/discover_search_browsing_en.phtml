<h1 id="anchor">Search</h1>
<h2>Simple Search</h2>
<p>Enter a term in the search field and leave the search category on “All Fields”. The system will then search for this term in all
   possible search fields. The drop-down menu allows you to narrow the search down to one specific category: title, author, call number (DDC),
   subject or ISBN / ISSN.</p>

<p>You may specify your results by means of the filter settings in the right column of the search result list according to the
   following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>time: year of publication</li>
    <li>medium: open access, mediatype, format</li>
    <li>classification: call number (DDC), RelBib classification</li>
    <li>content: topic, genre, era, region</li>
    <li>form: language, author, publisher</li>
  </ul>
<p>Some of the filters allow multiple selection.</p>
<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
<p>You can start an “Advanced Search” if you click on the link underneath the search field. Compared to “Simple Search”, here it is possible to
   start a search in several fields at the same time and thus to render your search more precisely. The "Match" setting lets you specify how
   multiple search fields should be handled. For certain complex searches it might be more useful to operate with search groups.</p>
<p>In addition to that, in the advanced search mode you can narrow your search down <i>a priori</i> according to the following facets: RelBib classification;
   format; language. Moreover, it is possible beforehand to set a publication period as well as the number of results listed per page.</p>


<h1 id="anchor">Browsing</h1>
<h2>Find Topic</h2>
<p>The <a href="<?=$this->url('keywordchainsearch-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse Keywordchains')?></a> mode is intended to find subjects
   and standardized subject groups that are similar to the terms entered. This is especially useful to obtain subject groups and titles
   that are topically close to your originating search.
   You can also switch to this mode from the other way around: Select a specific title which was catalogued with subject headings.
   Just click on the <span class="iconlabel label label-info">B</span> button on the left of the subject heading string, and you will
   see other titles which were catalogued with that string.</p>
<h2>Browse by Category</h2>
<p>The <a href="<?=$this->url('browse-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse by Category')?></a> mode offers a way to start with some high
   level categories and refine your search to certain aspects without the need to know specific search terms beforehand. Categories provided are
   call number (DDC classmarks), RelBib classification, topic (subject heading), author and publisher. You are lead through a tree structure and may
   filter the items you wish to browse by using other fields.</p>
<h2>Browse Alphabetically</h2>
<p>The  <a href="<?=$this->url('alphabrowse-home')?>" target="_blank"><?=$this->transEsc('Browse Alphabetically')?></a> mode offers a comprehensive
   alphabetically sorted list of the contents of the respective categories. This is advantageous for survey research.
   You can decide at which point in the alphabet you would like to step in and choose from the following aspects:
   by topic, by author, by title or by call number.</p>
<p>This function is also useful when you are not sure how to spell the name of a given author or term: in that case just
   enter the first few letters of a word.</p>
