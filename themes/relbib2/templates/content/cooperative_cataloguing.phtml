<h1 id="anchor">Cooperative cataloguing with Zotero</h1>
<p>RelBib aims at indexing literature relevant to the study of religion as up-to-date, comprehensive and complete as possible. In order to achieve this goal, we are increasingly using semi-automated methods with which journal articles flow into the database more quickly than was previously possible. At the same time, we have begun to outsource the import of article data into RelBib to cooperating journal editors. To this end, we have set up a Zotero Group, through which articles relevant to the study of religion can be indexed directly in RelBib.</p>
<p>If you are interested, please take a look at this <a target="_blank" href="/docs/ZoteroGroup_Instruction_en.pdf">instruction</a> and feel free to contact us at any time.</p>
<p>Our current cooperation partners in cooperative cataloguing are:</p>
