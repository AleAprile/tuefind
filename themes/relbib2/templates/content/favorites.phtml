<h1 id="anchor">Saved items – saving, exporting, forwarding</h1>
<p>You can save interesting titles directly in your account. Click on the “Star”  <i class="result-link-icon fa fa-fw fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> symbol in the result list or in the full view. Saved items are permanently accessible, and you do not have to waste time searching for them again.</p>
<p>You may like to keep your “saved items” in different lists, which you define yourself. Thus, you can assign individual titles to specific research projects or collaborators.</p>
<p>Using your personal account, you can also export your saved items, send them per e-mail or print them. If you mark a list as "public", you can share it with your students by sending them the link to your list.</p>
